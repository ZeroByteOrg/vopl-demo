Finally found the key to unlock knowledge of how Wolf3d's audio works:

https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/AudioT_Format

playback rate is 700Hz.

file is in AUDIOT format:

HEADER = uint32LE offsets into AUDIOT.WL1
Each item is a "chunk" starting at that offset.
The final entry should point to the end of the last audio chunk.
Some header entries end up being zero bytes long - if a header X is followed by
another header Y and X = Y, then X is considered to not be a chunk.
Thus if Headers 21 and 22 both have the same offset value, then 22 would be chunk 21, not 22.


The actual Audio data is uncompressed in Wolf3d data files (yaaay)

Song offsets:
Adlib tunes start at chunk 207 - header starts at 0x414 (strange)
E1M1 (Get Them) = 3 (300) 0xa5e3 - ef10
Horst Lied (Nazi Nor Music) = 7 (314) 0xf019( - 0x1115f (8428 bytes after 2byte header)

Entries start with 2-byte LE marker showing size of song data within the chunk
Then after the chunk is a "trailer" containing the filename and other info.
2bytes = ?
char[16] = Song Title
char[64] = Remarks (usually the source filename)
char[6] = ?

So my extraction should take this into account.

One Q: How is looping handled? Is it assumed to just loop 100% always?
I think so.

Song data is very simple: byte REG,byte DATA,uint16LE Delay - over and over
Delay = #ticks where one tick =1/700 sec. This equates to 11 ticks per frame @60Hz.
Note that nothing in the data specifies the ticks rate - the games just used a value,
and different games used different values.
